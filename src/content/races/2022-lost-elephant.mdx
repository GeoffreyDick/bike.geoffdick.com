## The Night Before

Driving into Cranbrook, I was feeling a bit defeated. My first year of bikepack
racing was not off to a smooth start. A month prior I had scratched early in
what was supposed to be a leisurely-paced Yo-Yo attempt of the
[BC Epic 1000](https://www.bcepic1000.com/).

And now I was in the middle of missing the pre-race get-together for the Lost
Elephant. There had been a last-minute re-route just as I was about to start my
drive, forcing me to run back to my computer to download the new route and
upload it to my eTrex and my phone.

Then, on the final stretch of the Banff-Windermere Highway into Radium Hot
Springs, I had got stuck behind a fuel truck gingerly, carefully, and slooowly
making it's way down the steep road. I applaud the driver's safety, but the
extra hour of 10km/h "driving" had soured my mood.

However, as I passed the Cranbrook Chamber of Commerce, the start of tomorrow's
race, I shook off the grumps and decided to focus. It was time to race. I threw
my original idea of finding a nice place for dinner out the window, and instead
pulled into Tim Hortons so that I could get to bed nice and early. While
feasting on carbs, I double-checked the weather for the weekend and reviewed the
last-minute route changes. The weather looked hot and not being familiar with
that area of the route, I didn't have any opinions on the last-minute changes.

### Hotel Hardware

Belly full and mind at ease, I purchased a blueberry muffin for the morning and
made my way to my accommodations for the night: the parking lot of the Home
Hardware. There was a sign welcoming overnight camping, and it was only a block
away from the start of the race; good enough seeing as a I was going to sleep as
soon as possible. I backed into a corner spot, hitch facing a fenced-off storage
area for maximum privacy.

<Figure
	src={imgViewFromTheHotel}
	alt="A sunset, with a fenced-off storage area in the foreground"
	caption={'View from the luxurious Hotel Hardware in Cranbrook, BC'}
/>

As I finished packing, taking my earlier weather research into consideration, I
looked around the parking lot and discovered that the Hotel Hardware was
considerably less sketchy than I was expecting it to be. In fact, it felt just
like an RV Park. The majority of vehicles were of the camping variety. A trailer
parked nearby featured an older couple parked in a pair of lawnchairs, reading
in the evening sun. I had quick chat with them, and then crawled into the back
of the car for an early bedtime, just before 10pm, cuddling up with my bike. The
parking lot was nice, but I wasn't taking any chances.

## Day One

### Getting Ready

After a surprisingly restful sleep, I woke up at 4:45am and walked over to the
Tim Hortons which conveniently opened at 5am to brush my teeth and use the
washroom. On my way back to the car, I noticed that the parking lot was much
more full than it had been when I went to bed.

I hopped in my car and drove for roughly 90 seconds to the empty lot behind
Lordco Auto Parts which had been noted as a good spot to leave your vehicle for
the weekend, and it was right across the street from the start of the race.

I was one of the first to arrive so I set to getting my bike ready for the
weekend, in between taking bites of my blueberry muffin. Glen Buchanan then
parked next to me and pulled out his own blueberry muffin. I complimented his
choice of breakfast and we had a quick chat while we got ourselves in order.

As I made my way over to the Chamber of Commerce, I checked my shifting and brakes. Everything felt good. As riders arrived, we inspected each other's setups and made small talk while we waited for 6am.

### The Race Begins

<Checkpoint index={0} client:load client:only="svelte">
	When the clock struck six, Nathan, the organizer, made a casual "let's go" announcement and we set off, a pack of
	gear-laden cyclists taking up a lane of the Crowsnest Highway out of Cranbrook until we could hop on the Chief Isadore
	Trail.
</Checkpoint>

	/>
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint index={160} client:load client:only="svelte">
	After a few minutes on the Chief Isadore, the group encountered the first challenge of the race: a gate. Everyone
	patiently waited as the first rider opened the gate, and then riders started funneling through. As I went through,
	near the front of the group, I thought "I hope whoever goes through last closes it". I'll never know if they did.
</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint index={270} client:load client:only="svelte">
	A short stretch of highway shoulder later, we were back on gravel. This is where the race began. With room to pass,
	riders began to shuffle for position and up at the front of the pack, Andy Ward and Everett Craig laid some extra
	power down and pulled away from the rest of the group. It was on.

I was already pushing a bit harder than I knew was a sustainable race pace, so I happily let them drop me. They were doing the Jumbo anyways. My plan was to go a bit harder until Fort Steele, at which point I'd back off and take it easy for the 1343m climb to Top of the World Provincial Park ahead. I was not 100% awake at this point so I was hoping a harder effort up front would put some pep in my step. It didn't work.

<Figure src={imgMistyMorning} alt="A misty morning sunrise coming out of Cranbrook" caption={'A misty morning'} />

</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint index={410} client:load client:only="svelte">
### Topping the World

    After the pavement ended at Fort Steele, the gravel road wasted no time in becoming a climb. With the change
    of grade came an onslaught of yawns. A caffeinated Nuun tab and the sugariest bar in my bag were no match. It wasn't
    until the first rays of sunshine peeked over the hills that I finally woke up.

</Checkpoint>

<Checkpoint index={735} client:load client:only="svelte">
	<Figure src={imgPraiseTheSun} alt="Sunrise just behind hills" caption={'Praise the sun'} />
</Checkpoint>

The next two hours flew by. Because of the climb, most riders were still quite close together, so there was always someone to talk to. And despite the grade, the road was in good condition. Until it wasn't.

Eventually, the steady gravel road turned into unmaintained quad track and the grade inclined further. It was technically rideable, but I felt walking would be more efficient, especially with drop-bars and no suspension, so I hopped off and started pushing. At this point I was "riding" with my muffin twin Glen, and he was somehow still grinding away on the cranks. Impressive.

Despite the effort and the steadily increasing temperature, I was enjoying this section. I had decided to wear a sun hoody for the race after looking at the forecast, and in this moment I was very happy with that decision. Exposed sections of the trail were already roasting in spite of the fact that it was not even 10am. But I knew after reaching the top, there would be a long gradual gravel descent where I could likely enjoy a breeze. I stopped in the middle of a shaded creek that was crossing the trail to refill my water and cool off, and then I was back to pushing.

<Figure
	src={imgAlmostAtTheTop}
	alt="A view back down the valley"
	caption={'A short reprieve from the hike-a-bike, just before the top'}
/>

<Checkpoint index={1900} client:load client:only="svelte" />
When I reached the top, I met up with Nathan, Justin, and Stephen. After a short break, we began our descent. A few minutes
after doing so, Nathan informed us that we had accidentally taken the more technical route down, but that it would meet back
up soon. This turned out to be a fun detour. Steep singletrack had me pushing my drop-bars to their limits and I somehow
found myself ahead of the three mountain bikers by the time I reached the gravel road. Knowing the section ahead would favour
my drop-bars + aero-bars setup, I decided to take advantage of the unexpected overtake and tucked in for an aero descent
from Top of the World Provincial Park.

### A Lesson on Speed

This section was fast. However, it was not to be taken lightly. Spring melt had clearly crossed the road earlier in the year as there were many narrow ruts breaking the otherwise smooth gravel, as well as deep pot-holes here and there. Both of which could easily cause a crash for an unaware rider. I kept my eyes peeled, hopping ruts, dodging pot-holes, and enjoying the breeze.

<Checkpoint index={2850} client:load client:only="svelte" />
The fun ended though when I stopped to filter water at Coyote Creek. No longer moving, the heat made itself known again.
As I sat in the sun, sweating and urging my filter to flow faster, I realized I had made a mistake. Filtering water was a
poor choice for racing. I watched Nathan, Justin, and Andrew ride past on the bridge, kicked myself for my amateur water
strategy, and made a mental note for after the race: **buy water treatment tablets**.

### Lakeside Reunions

Fuelled by regret, I made my way up the hill that was the last obstacle between me and Alces Lake. On the other side, I bombed down the descent to the entrance of the campground and found a whole group of riders taking advantage of the shade by the water pump. Nathan, Justin, and Andrew had been joined by Dave Waugh and Jody Funk who were racing the Jumbo.

<Checkpoint index={3200} client:load client:only="svelte" />
Happy to have caught up, I oiled my chain and had a snack while the group debated whether or not drinking the pump's water
untreated would be a good idea or not. With the debate still going on, I biked up into the campground to find an outhouse
while I had the luxury of one. When I returned to the water pump, I found that the group had left. Spying them not too far
down the road, I put a few extra watts in the pedals to catch up.

### Turning Up the Heat

<Checkpoint index={3300} client:load client:only="svelte" />
This section of the road provided an emotional boost. While the gravel descent from Top of the World Provincial Park had
been fun, it hadn't been scenic. Biking past Whiteswan Lake however offered nice views to the left, and shade-providing cliffs
to the right. I enjoyed the shade, but in hindsight, not as much as I should have.

<Figure src={imgWhiteswanLake} alt="The road along Whiteswan Lake" caption={'Praise the shade'} />

<Checkpoint index={3366} client:load client:only="svelte" />

At the end of the lake, the Dumbo and Jumbo routes split off, and the slog began. What little cooling effect the water had provided was gone. The road was dusty and the sun was hot. Thankfully, the road hugged the White River which provided visual interest and opportunities for refreshingly cold water.

<Figure src={imgWhiteRiver} alt="The road along the White River" caption={'More like White Hot River'} />

<Checkpoint index={3780} client:load client:only="svelte" />
The confluence of the White River and East White River provided a much needed change in scenery. The road opened into a wide
valley which had somewhat recently experienced a forest fire. On the way to recovery, the valley was now filled with wildflowers,
eliciting a "wow" from my dust-dried mouth.

    <Figure src={imgGlamourShot} alt="Bike amongst wildflowers, leaning against a wayfinding sign" caption={'Beautiful'} />

Unfortunately, this forest fire of the past also meant that any trees had been stripped of their greenery. My sun hoody was worth its weight in gold at this point.

    <Figure src={imgChangeOfScenery} alt="Winding road through wildfire regrowth" caption={'A welcome change of scenery'} />

### Up Koko Claims

After taking some glamour shots of my bike amongst the wildflowers, I set off up the road to the northern-most point of the route. This was roughly the third-of-the-way point I had determined from eyeballing the map and I was excited for a milestone, however arbitrary.

<Checkpoint index={3890} client:load client:only="svelte" />

It was here that Angela Etheridge caught up with me. I was feeling drained from the heat but a new riding companion brought some life back into me. We eventually caught up with the now extremely familiar trio of Nathan, Justin, and Stephen who I had been leapfrogging with all afternoon. And it was at this moment, a third of the way into the race, that I knew who I was competing against.

<Checkpoint index={4500} client:load client:only="svelte" />
Unfortunately, this competitive spirit didn't last long. As we met back up with the Jumbo route and turned East towards Koko
Claims, my energy hit a low point. I was starting to feel dehydrated and losing interest in the food I had brought. Despite
the definite rideability of this section, I chose to walk it, letting the others pull ahead while I tried to drink more water
and eat more food.

<Checkpoint index={4600} client:load client:only="svelte" />
Fortunately, my energy picked up just as the incline did. At this point, I was stoked for an excuse not to ride and the ridiculous
grade provided just that.

    <Figure src={imgSteepKokoClaims} alt="An impossibly steep hill of loose gravel and stones" caption={"A picture doesn't do the steepness justice"} />

Having followed the Tour Divide for a few years, I was excited to see what all the fuss was about, and it did not disappoint. Nearing the top, moving forward meant throwing my bike up the hill a foot or so, locking the brakes, and then pulling myself up. I was loving the absurdity of it. By the time I reached the top, I had a smile on my face. It wasn't a quick ascent, but it was a fun one. Am I a masochist?

    <Figure src={imgKokoClaimsCabin} alt="A small cabin at the top of Koko Claims" caption={'No views at the top other than this cabin'} />

### Down Koko Claims

Seeing the cabin at the top, I thought "how the hell do people drive up here"? And then seeing the downhill on the other side I thought, "how the hell do people bike down here"?.

    <Figure src={imgRideableButSketchy} alt="A steep descent full of loose rocks" caption={'Rideable, but sketchy'} />

It took a second, but that latter question settled in. How am I going to bike down here? It was very obvious that trying to ride down would be a bad idea, at least on my drop-bar bike. The road was littered with giant sized "gravel" and with no-dropper post, my weight would be way too far forward. I considered lowering my seatpost, but that would mean removing my seatpack as I was cutting it close with tire clearance already. Too much work. I accepted my fate.

    <Figure src={imgUnrideable} alt="An even steeper descent, with larger and looser rocks" caption={'Completely unrideable'} />

I carefully picked my way through the rocks, occasionally riding a few seconds at a time. It was slow going. And knowing that my competition, Nathan, Justin, and Stephen were on mountain bikes made it worse. I knew they would have been able to ride much more of the descent, and likely had a good lead on me now. And while Angela too was on drop-bars, she seemed like a strong rider and had mentioned doing Koko Claims during a training ride, so I was sure she'd have something up her sleeve.

Eventually the road became rideable, though still steep and still rocky. I was riding fast and braking hard. I had to stop a couple of times to shake my hands out from squeezing the brakes for so long. This was arguably worse than walking down. With no suspension, I was getting shaken apart and my hands were screaming. Eventually I spotted the turn off onto the Elkford Community Trail, skidding past it, and then doubling back.

### Elkford

I was excited for some mellow singletrack into town, but first I had to give my hands a break. While I shook them out, I had a snack and checked [Trackleaders](http://trackleaders.com/lostelephant22) for the first time in the race. Nathan was already past Elkford, Justin and Stephen appeared to be stopped at one of the gas stations on route, snd Angela was still on trail ahead of me. Determined to make up lost time, I tackled the singletrack as fast as I could, which was... not very fast.

As I pulled into the outskirts of Elkford, through a residential area, I heard the rev of an engine and looked over just in time to see someone on a dirtbike crash at a T-intersection a block down, presumably attempting some sort of cool maneuver. It was not cool. His bike slid into the middle of the intersection he ended up on his back. After a moment he stood up, no helmet on of course, and dejectedly walked over to pick up his ride. Seeing that he was alright, I looked away, pretending that I had seen nothing, and continued on.

I pulled up to the gas station and was delighted to see that Justin, Stephen, and Angela were all still there. Checking the time, I knew they had been here for a while already and would likely be heading out soon. I quickly restocked food from the gas station, searching for salty snacks, my body begging for more electrolytes. I then rushed to brush my teeth and refill my water in the washroom. After exiting, I discovered that Angela had just left, and Justin and Andrew were making final preparations. I stuffed everything in my bag and joined them, pleased that I had made up for my slow traverse of Koko Claims.

### To Sparwood

Shortly after leaving Elkford, we hopped onto the Sulphur Springs Trail. This was a surprise to me. Why? I hadn't looked at this area of the route very closely and assumed it was going to be gravel. Why? I don't know.

However, I didn't have time to be surprised by my idiocy because I had another surprise to attend to: I felt fresh. That Formula One style pitstop had worked some magic. My legs were raring to go. I took the first opportunity to pass Justin and Andrew on the singletrack and then soon found myself on doubletrack where I was able to make use of my newfound energy.

Eventually though, as the sun began to set, the route took me off of the speedy doubletrack and onto a trail/road of questionable quality. Time to turn the lights on. It was quite overgrown and the bugs were coming out. Seeing a long stone-strewn hill ahead, I decided this was a good time for a quick call to my partner. I walked up the hill as we had a quick chat, and then seeing the top up ahead, I wished her goodnight and hopped back on the bike.

As I crested the hill, I found Angela setting up camp at an intersection. She said the bugs were getting too bad for her liking and that she was going to sleep for a bit. I considered setting up camp as well, but I was still feeling fresh and knew this was an opportunity to gain even more ground, so I said goodnight to her as well.

### Oops One: Eyes on the Road

I hopped on my bike, taking the Sparwood-orientated fork of the intersection. I found myself in a deep tire trench descending a hill. Feeling suspicious, I looked down at my GPS to make sure I was on track. I was not. Flabbergasted that I had gone the wrong direction, I started braking, looking around for a hidden trailhead. Not paying attention to the road ahead, my front tire hit a patch of loose gravel, and my wheel washed out from underneath me. I hit the ground hard, the left side of my torso landing right on the edge of the tire trench that I was now laying in.

After the obligatory moment of stillness following a crash, I checked the damage. Ribs didn't feel broken, but my side sure as hell hurt, and there were a few scrapes on my leg, but nothing worthy of first aid. I groaned into a sitting position and inspected my bike. It appeared to have fared better than me. I picked it up, smacked a brake lever back into position, scanned the ground for lost items, and then made my way back up the hill to the intersection.

As I crested the intersection hill again, this time from the other side, I had my fingers crossed that Angela hadn't heard my crash. I don't know if she did, but her question was "Wrong turn?", not "You okay?". So I assumed my shame was safe for now. I groaned out an affirmative and looked around for the turn I had missed. There it was, a subtle trailhead next to the road I had taken, easy to miss in the dark. I felt a bit better.

### Nightrider

As I pedalled away and the adrenaline faded, I could feel the effects of the crash more clearly. Pulling on my handlebars, I could tell that I had bruised my left lat, and likely a rib or two underneath it. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great, especially considering I was only about halfway through the race.

Luckily, the trail quickly spit me out onto a well maintained gravel road where I could flop into my aerobars and cover some ground relatively pain-free. At this point it was completely dark, but crash or no crash, I was set on making it to Sparwood before sleeping. I put on some appropriate nighttime tunes, and enjoyed the gravel. It was uneventful other than one large pair of eyes in the darkness to my left that stared at me as I went by. It was probably a cow, but my mind was seeing a large grizzly standing on its hind legs. I looked behind me just in case. Nothing in pursuit.

Eventually I reached a spot on the route that I had flagged during my route research as an easy-to-miss turn off. After a short stretch of pavement, the route went offroad onto a barely visible quad track into the trees. My research paid off and I spotted the faint tire tracks in the grass. Before heading into the trees, I took advantage of the long sightlines to stop and eat one of the two bags of chips that I had purchased in Elkford.

Sodium levels restored, I plunged into the darkness of the forest. This quad track was very overgrown; a tunnel through the trees; a bear's paradise. I belted out a few of the most presence-establishing "hey bear"s that I could muster, wincing at the pain in my ribs.

Thankfully, the quad track was short and soon spit me back onto pavement. And not just any pavement, civilized pavement. There were houses, and lights, and signs. Not many, but some. I was on the final stretch to Sparwood.

Cranking the music, I tucked in and bombed down the smooth pavement. I was having a blast. The best part of night riding is that the world is yours. Other than a family of skunks prancing cutely along the side of the road, I didn't see a single soul, and I was loving it.

### Oops Two: Don't Make Assumptions

**Things I Tested**

- Headlight
- Portable Battery
- PedalCell dynamo
- USB C to USB C cable

**Things I Didn't Test**

- All of those things together

As the route veered off the pavement onto a fieldside trail, I noticed that my light was running low on battery. Knowing that I'd only be riding for one night and that I had plenty of backup power, I had been running it on a brighter setting. Why not? So I stopped to plug my light into my portable battery and carried on.

After reaching Highway 43 which would take me into Sparwood, I looked down and noticed that my light wasn't charging. That's weird. Maybe my battery is a dud? Luckily I had a PedalCell dynamo for backup power. I engaged it to my rim, moved the USB cable from the battery to the PedalCell, and started pedalling again.

Uh oh.

    <Figure src={imgOopsTwo} alt="A blurry photo of a light that is on, but not charging" caption={'If you squint, you can see the charging not taking place'} />

I was definitely going fast enough for the PedalCell to kick in, but the light still wasn't charging, so I knew I had a problem. Troubleshooting, I moved the USB cable from my light to my phone, and from the PedalCell back to the battery, and immediately saw my phone begin to charge.

Uh oh.

A horrifying realization occurred: **my light was charging my battery, not the other way around**. I knew this was a feature of my light. It had a 5000mAh battery that could be used as a portable battery. When I bought it, I thought it was a pointless feature, now I realized it was a dangerous one. I had only ever used the light with a USB A to USB C cable. But with a USB C to USB C cable, the current was flowing in the wrong direction. Shit.

I switched the light to its lowest setting and carried on to Sparwood. It died just outside of town, but I had small headlamp attached to my helmet which was enough for the final minutes into Sparwood.

### A Wrench in the Plan

My sleep strategy going into the race: sleep until I got cold. With the warm forecast, I had only brought an SOL Escape Bivy and a half-length foam sleeping pad. Not exactly cozy.

Riding the next section in the dark with only a small headlamp would not be fun. It was singletrack. My original plan was now a last resort.

My last hope is that a gas station would still be open and that I'd be able to purchase a USB A to USB C cable. No such luck. It was midnight as I entered Sparwood and it was a ghost town, nothing open.

As I mulled over my options, I biked over to take a selfie with The World's Largest Tandem-Axle Truck, a Sparwood must. Here, I took a second to check Trackleaders again. It looked like Nathan too had stopped in Sparwood for the night. So I set off to find my own spot.

    <Figure src={imgSparwoodSelfie} alt="A nighttime selfie in front of the World's Largest Tandem Axle Truck" caption={'Spirits high, despite my current situation'} />

I biked over to the high school and setup my bivy in some bushes at the edge of the field. I was hoping this spot would be quiet enough and warm enough to sleep through the night. It was not.

Two and a half hours later, I woke up freezing. This was a bad spot. The school was at the bottom of a hill and the cold had settled in, the adjacent field was already covered in dew.

I briefly considered starting the singletrack section, but with roughly three hours until dawn, my icy bones convinced to find somewhere warm and wait for a revitalizing cup of coffee before heading out.

Rolling up my bivy, I set it precariously on top of my handlerbars and went in search of warmth. I found a post office nearby, pulled my bike inside, and unrolled my bivy in a cozy looking corner, immediately falling back asleep.

## Day Two

At 4:15am I woke again, this time to the alarm I had set notifying me that Tim Hortons was about to open. I was no more rested than I had been after my previous awakening, but I was significantly warmer. I packed my bags, making sure to leave my corner of the post office as clean as I had found it, and then made a beeline for Tim Hortons.

I grabbed a coffee and some carbs and sat down at a booth to wait for a sign of dawn before heading out. I checked Trackleaders just in time to watch Dave Cleveland's dot cross the Dumbo finish line. Woah. Mental note: **train more**. And not too far behind Dave was Julie Labreque, and not too far behind Julie was Dan Perron. That left Nathan and I tied for fourth, ~150km behind the winner. Woah.

Looking further back along the map, Angela was still where I had last seen her, and Justin and Stephen had camped somewhere past that, meaning that Nathan and I had a decent headstart on the second day.

Speaking of whom, as I was starting to pack my bags, Nathan rolled in, looking much fresher than I was feeling. We had a quick chat and then I made by way back to the World's Largest Tandem Axle Truck to refill my water at a fountain (colder than the faucets of the Tim Horton's washroom). As I was doing so, I saw Nathan bike by. His Tim Hortons visit was much quicker than mine. But having seen how strong of a rider he was yesterday, and knowing that he probably had a much better sleep, I was in no rush to chase him.

### Elk Valley Trail

As I hopped onto the local singletrack that would eventually link up with the Elk Valley Trail and take me to Fernie, I was feeling groggy, but optimistic. The soil was loamy, a vast improvement from the dusty everything of the day before, and it was largely downhill for the next 40km. Easy.
